# About

I'm not a coder so I leveraged ChatGPT to create this. Output is a table that includes Name of Site, Last Time Checked, Last Time Updated. The goal is figure out a way to automate these podcasts are active.

## Python requirements

According to ChatGPT it leverages the following libraries:

- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- pandas

## Text file

This pulls information from a website.txt file that includes just the name of the site, one per line and provides the information from it.
