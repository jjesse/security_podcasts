# List of Great Security Podcasts

Recently there was a post (<https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/w8wbjm/41_cybersecurity_podcasts>) on r/cybersecurity (<https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/>) listing 44 security focused podcasts and then the discussion grew from there. The problem with the list was there were no links and no grouping of these. This tries to solve that problem
